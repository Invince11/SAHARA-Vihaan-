# NOTE 
 
 1. IMAGE CAPTIONING 

We wanted to generate captions from image but the training of the RNN and LSTM model for this would take 1-2 weeks to train. Thus, as of now we did object detection.


2. NAVIGATION

Use of google map navigation was to be used.

3. RASPBERRY PI

Use of raspberry pi and bluetooth ear phones along with mic would make it a perfect hardware solution.



DUE TO LACK OF TIME AND INTEGRATING SKILLS WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE A VAGUE SOLUTION FOR THE PROTOTYPE WE WISHED TO PITCH.
